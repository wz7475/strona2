            Our Fake History is an award-winning podcast about myths people think are history and history that might be
            hidden in myths. Have you ever heard that old story about how Napoleon shot the nose off the sphinx, or that
            Shakespeare was an illiterate fraud, or that Queen Elizabeth was actually a man? This show explores those
            tall-tales and tries to figure out what’s fact, what’s fiction, and what is such a good story it simply must
            be told. The podcast combines storytelling, humour, and historical detective work to create a show that is
            good for both history buffs and anyone who loves a good story.

            The podcast is produced in Toronto, Canada, by Sebastian Major with help from his wife Beth Lorimer.
            Sebastian is a teacher, musician, and storyteller who is passionate about all things weird and wonderful
            from the past. All the transition music used on the podcast is written and recorded in-house by Sebastian.
